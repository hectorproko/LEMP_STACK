# IMPLEMENTING LEMP STACK
Before we start we need to have an environemnt to work with. I will we using my AWS account to create an EC2 instance with an Ubuntu Server.

* First thing I'm going to do when I log in to AWS is look for the **EC2** services. There are various methods to navigate to it, here I'm using the **search bar** <br />

* Once you navigate to the **EC2** page look for a **Launch instance** button <br />

* You will then be prompted to pick an OS Image. I will be using **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume**. Once done click **Select**

* I will pick the **t2.micro** instace type <br />

* I will leave default settings and click **Review and Launch** <br />

* As you can see we have a Security Group applied to the instance by default which allows SSH connections <br />

* After reviewing you can launch your instancing by clicking <br />

* We are prompted to create or use an existing Key Pair. I will be creating a new one. I will use this .pem key to SSH into the instance later on. <br />

* Once you have downloaded your key launch intance <br />

* To go to the instances dashboard <br />

* If your instance is up and running you will see something like this <br />

* To find information on how to connect click on your **Instance ID**

* In the top-right corner you should see the button **Connect**, click on it <br /> 
![Markdown Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hectorproko/LEMP_SATCK/main/images/Connect.png)

* Look for the **SSH client** tab <br /> 
![Markdown Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hectorproko/LEMP_SATCK/main/images/SSHclient.png)

* Under **Example** you'll find an **ssh** command with eveything you need to connect to the instance from a terminal

**Examaple:**
```bash
ssh -i "daro.io.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-216-90-84.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```
Make sure when you run the command that your current working directory in the terminal is where your KeyPair/.pem is located because in the above example I'm using a relative path to point to my key

* A successful log-in <br />
